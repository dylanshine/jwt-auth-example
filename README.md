# JWT Auth Example

## Summary
While there is good overall documentation for JWT and Auth, we experienced some issues actually getting it all together and having it run well. So we wrote a little example that puts it all together:
- Having a user register (email + password)
- Having a user login and get tokens (access + refresh)
- Check a user based on access-token
- Renew the access-token based on refresh-token

## Disclaimer

This example is coming from a production-ready system, however it is significantly simplified and reduced to help understand JWT + Auth, not to give you a full template for user management. You should not use this template for anything else but helping you understand JWT.

## Configuration
All required config files are provided. You simply need to fill out the blanks in "keys.json" with your own values.
